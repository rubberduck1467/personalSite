        <h1> Jeremy Cope's Homepage </h1>
        <p> I am a highschool student from Chandler, Arizona with interest in mathematics, computer science, and language. I am also enjoy skiing and hiking (I know, touching grass, scary)</p>

        <h2> Links </h2>
        <p> Here are some links to other pages of mine. If I ever have social media again I will stick it here. </p>

        <a href="https://github.com/rubberduck1467">My Github</a>
        <p>Email me at <a href="mailto:jcope0787@protonmail.com">jcope0787@protonmail.com</a> </p>

        <h2> Mathematics </h2>
        <p> I am currently studying AP Calculus as a Sophomore. I intend to major in Applied Mathematics and enjoy mathematical problems.
        I am also have experience with LaTeX and prefer it for writing. I will put links to any papers I write here along with other interesting topics </p>

        <h3> Pi Day </h3>
                        <p> Math Holidays Best Holidays </p>
                        <p> Mostly working, estimate with Polygons: <a href="personalsite/assets/n-gon-estimate.pdf">n-gon-estimate.pdf</a></p>

        <h2> Computer Science </h2>
        <p> I have done most of my programming on Vex VRC robots using C++ but I also have experience with C and LISP(WIP). I have experimented with Typescript, Haskell, Java, x86 Assembly, and others,
        but I would hardly consider myself versed in those languages. Also, I am an avid Linux user :). </p>

        <h3> A couple specific repos </h3>
        <p> Everything is Licensed FOSS (either MIT or GPL) </p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rubberduck1467/robotics20242025">Robotics 2024-2025 (C++)</a><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/rubberduck1467/cSnake">A Terminal Snake Game (C)</a><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/rubberduck1467/personalSite">My Homepage (HTML)</a><br>

        <h3> Linux </h3>
        <p> I have run both bare metal Linux and WSL. I prefer bare metal but having Windows is somewhat handy as a student.
                I use Debian on my subsystem and ZSH with OhMyZsh. Vim is the best editor.</p>

        <h2> Language </h2>
        <p> I speak English (C1) natively and am in the process of learning German (~A1-A2) and Greek (not even A1). </p>

        <h2> Outdoors </h2>
        <p> I ski almost every winter usually at Snowbowl, Vail, or Purgatory. I also enjoy hiking on South Mountain in Phoenix.
        I use Slopes and AllTrails for data collection. </p>
